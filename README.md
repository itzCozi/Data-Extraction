# File Data Extraction - Python Package
The data extraction package was made for the soul purpose of me being bored I also recently learned how to extract list and other data from a file and while looking up how to do it I found nothing no one has ever asked and theres no packages so I made one. Ladies and Gentlemen I present to you the data extraction package. It comes equipped with a clearconsole function to clear the console screen of any user. A extractlist function this will make list out of a file, every line is a iteam in the list. A extracttable function this does the same as the extractlist but it joins each line to create a string and then adds that to the list. A filterfile function which will search a file for the given word and if found remove the word. A randomhex function that returns a hex digest in the form of a string this digest is always less than 20 characters.

**Features**

- Clear console
- Filter file
- Extract list
- Extract table
- Random hex


## Examples
The following are examples of a couple of ways to use the package.
